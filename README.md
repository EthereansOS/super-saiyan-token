## History

For thousands of years, the ability to transform into a new token standard was considered only a legend. 

ERCs harbored potential that was hidden from the Ethereum world, but the ERC20 and ERC1155 standards alone were not powerful enough techniques to unleash itâ€¦ until now!

By synthesizing the ancient ERC20 technique with the advanced ERC1155 one, we have created the ethItem standard, and the first experimental ethItem token: Super Saiya-jin! SSJ achieves standard-interoperability to unlock the true power of Ethereum.

As both a governance token to manage proposals for the buidlersâ€™ Sandbox DFO and an upgradeable digital art NFT, the SSJ token is the first example of what can be accomplished by innovating with the state of the art ethItem technology.

We await to see what else the Ethereum galaxy bringsâ€¦

### Let the customizations begin!

Super Saiya-jin Token (SSJ) is our first experiment involving the new <a href="https://github.com/b-u-i-d-l/eth-item-token-standard">ethItem token standard</a>.

### It is an ERC1155 NFT:

<a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xe8bd225aab19cd3cc0e98bd510e4b2fab91247a4/1031500871419234211074616426984759611806302958341">Opensea</a>

### AND an ERC20 Token:

<a href="https://uniswap.info/token/0xb4ae194a0dcf1b4080b164c1d775ee06e0817305">Uniswap</a>

To find the ERC1155 NFT, take look on:

<a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe8bd225aab19cd3cc0e98bd510e4b2fab91247a4#readContract">Etherscan Contract</a>

Now try to query the â€˜1. asErc20â€™ function, inserting the following Token ID:

1031500871419234211074616426984759611806302958341

You will reach the correspective ERC20 version! <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb4ae194a0dcf1b4080b164c1d775ee06e0817305">Etherscan</a>

â€¦Psst! Hey, Pro user! Calculate the Hex value of this Token Id and see what happens! ðŸ‘€

## So, whatâ€™s the purpose of SSJ anyway?

To begin with, itâ€™s the ERC20 voting token of the <a href="https://dapp.dfohub.com/?addr=0xd5F8E370130ebBF6dF7bF742866ff056331Fd73C">buidlersâ€™ Sandbox DFO</a>.

But, as a ERC1155, it also contains interesting expandable metadata that can be extremely useful to unleash the true power of decentralization. It avoids mandatory, annoying, brand-related procedures (like token listings in DEX/AMMs, or logo approvals).

SSJ is realized as an extension of the <a href="https://github.com/b-u-i-d-l/eth-item-token-standard">ethItem token standard</a>.

You can farm it and start ruling the Sandbox DFO using <a href="https://uniswap.info/pair/0x0a71ac080b82a794757b00e2f2d96e0e9463f48d">uSD</a>, the stablecoin of <a href="https://www.unifihub.com">UniFi</a>, by <a href="https://dapp.dfohub.com/?staking=0x792BF16B9C6CaD4c180C0031F32c39EB51d6A290">Liquidity Mining Here</a>

This is just the beginning!

## SSJ Distribution

- (7.7%) 77.900 SSJ was distributed among wallets holding more than 900 buidl, arte or UniFi (100 SSJ each)

- (10%) 100.000 SSJ was sent to the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x25756f9c2cceacd787260b001f224159ab9fb97a">NERV Operation Wallet</a> which will inflate the supply by 100 SSJ each day for a total of 36.500 SSJ yearly.

- (5%) 50.000 SSJ was sent to the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x5d40c724ba3e7ffa6a91db223368977c522bdacd">DFOhub Wallet</a>, owned by buidl holders

- The rest, 755,000 (76%), is locked in the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xeE4ccfB9341E27AbE3c8dE2F63694cc1ba71026B">Sandbox DFO Wallet, to be farmed by <a href="https://dapp.dfohub.com/?staking=0x792BF16B9C6CaD4c180C0031F32c39EB51d6A290">SSJ-uSD stakers</a>

The Sandbox Quorum is 300,000 SSJ and the max cap is 500,000 youâ€™ll be able to reach it in 4-5 months.
